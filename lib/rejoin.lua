-- Rejoin (crash-relaunch resume): fast-forwards through the player's own
-- buffered RLOG events for the still-active run via the same bootstrap/
-- driver machinery "My Replays" uses (lib/playback_launch.lua/
-- lib/playback_handlers.lua), then hands off to live play by rejoining the
-- real lobby instead of ending in a "replay finished" toast. Opponent
-- catch-up (whatever they did while this player was disconnected) is NOT
-- triggered manually here -- it already fires automatically once
-- MPAPI.join_lobby reconnects: the server's grace-period cancel pushes a
-- replay-tail (grace-period.service.ts's pushReplayCatchUp), and
-- pvp_api/reconnect_tail.lua already applies it off that same
-- connection-state event chain, unrelated to this file.
--
-- Takes `active` (MPAPI.replay.get_active_run's own response shape --
-- {runId, lobbyCode, modId, events}) rather than fetching by run_id itself:
-- an ACTIVE run has no DB-persisted matchRunLogs row yet (only written at
-- finalize), so MPAPI.replay.get(run_id) 403s "not a participant" for a
-- genuinely active run's own participant -- confirmed live. `events` is
-- already this player's own buffered stream (server-side getTail against
-- the live in-memory buffer), so no second fetch is needed at all.
