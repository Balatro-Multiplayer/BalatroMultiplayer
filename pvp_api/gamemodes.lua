-- Bridge GameModes: thin MPAPI.GameMode entry points that delegate into PVP's own
-- ruleset/gamemode/pool-gating machinery (the BRIDGE approach — PVP's composition
-- system stays authoritative; see the plan). Each maps a server/website game-mode
-- key (pvp_chocolate/pvp_vanilla/pvp_strawberry/pvp_smallworld/pvp_royale/
-- pvp_manhunt/pvp_teams — the exact keys the matchmaking server + web leaderboard
-- expect, queried as `ranked:<key>`) onto a PVP ruleset + shape.
--
-- These MUST be loaded inside MPAPI.on_loaded so their GameObjects are tagged to
-- this mod (per-lobby action/gamemode routing depends on the owning mod id).
--
-- Blind selection and ante progression are intentionally NO-OPS here: PVP's own
-- ui/game/round.lua + lovely wiring drive the nemesis/showdown blinds off
-- PVP.LOBBY.config, so the API's reset_blinds/ease_ante overlay (api/gamemode/hooks.lua)
-- must not also mutate the blinds. get_blinds_by_ante returns nothing so the API
-- overlay is a harmless no-op; on_ante_change does nothing. The one API-side hook we
-- do use is on_player_forfeit -> check_single_survivor (win when the opponent quits).

-- The defined winning code path: a gamemode's on_player_forfeit just returns
-- { winner = player_id } and never touches an ActionType or a lobby object.
