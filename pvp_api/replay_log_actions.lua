-- MPAPI transport for MP.RLOG (lib/replay_log.lua): replaces the legacy
-- Client.send({action="streamLogLines"/"submitLogHashes"}) calls, which
-- pvp_api/net.lua's router now silently drops (both are unlisted there --
-- "owned by the API now, or replay-stream features deferred for the port").
--
-- One event per broadcast, not batched: this is deliberately per-line, not
-- per-25-lines/2-seconds like the old stream, so a spectator (once built) is
-- literally watching each log line arrive as it happens, not a periodic
-- catch-up dump. `args` carries either the positional action-args table (an
-- array, mirrors the local carbon line's own tokens) or, for the reserved
-- framing opcodes "manifest"/"end"/"chk", the frame's own dict payload --
-- MPAPI's action-param validation only checks `type(value) == "table"`, so
-- both shapes satisfy the same schema without a second ActionType.
--
-- on_receive tracks the opponent's own elapsed-t high-water mark (Phase 9:
-- reconnect tail-replay) -- MP.RLOG._last_seen_t[player_id] is how far into
-- that player's own RLOG stream this client has observed live, so a
-- reconnecting client knows what `since_t` to request via
-- MPAPI.replay.get_tail after missing some broadcasts while disconnected.
-- Keyed by the SENDER's own clock (params.t, elapsed since THEIR begin_run),
-- not local wall-clock time, so it stays meaningful regardless of when this
-- client itself connected/reconnected. Broadcasts loop back to the sender
-- (see pvp_api/actions.lua's self_id() convention), so a client's own events
-- are skipped -- there's nothing to "catch up" on for your own stream. The
-- server-side buffering client and, later, spectators are the other
-- consumers of this same broadcast; this is purely an additional local
-- bookkeeping side effect, not a second dispatch path.
